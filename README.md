# Single-Layer-Perceptron
**Single Layer Perceptrons** are the fundamental of **Neural Networks**. They are very effective on **linearly separable** classes.

# How it looks like

# What does this code do ?

1.  Takes the input data pairs (x,y coordinates)
2.  Takes the targets which is represented in these coordinates
3.  Draws a linear line between these 2 classes ( if linearly separable)

# Notes

1.  I just used C++ to create the algorithm
2.  Opencv library is just used for visualization of the results, you may delete if you dont have in your environment
