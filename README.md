# Single-Layer-Perceptron
**Single Layer Perceptrons** are the fundamental of **Neural Networks**. They are very effective on **linearly separable** classes. 

# What does this code do ?

1.  Takes the input data pairs (x,y coordinates)
2.  Takes the targets which is represented in these coordinates
3.  Draws a linear line between these 2 classes ( if linearly separable)
